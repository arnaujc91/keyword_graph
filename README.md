# keyword_graph

In order to correlate keywords in a document what I do is to split the document into smaller pieces: what I call paragraphs -paragraphs are obtained using the function .splitlines(). Then we identify which keywords are contained in every paragraph and we define an arbitrary distance between paragraphs which is an integer that i call 'k'. If two keywords are found in two paragraphs which fall appart in a distance smaller than 'k', then I consider they have a link. Obviously there may be many links if the frequency of the keywords is high enough. The ammount of links by itself is not really representative of the correlation between keywords: we normalize this number with respect to some value that assures the correlation is meaningfull.
